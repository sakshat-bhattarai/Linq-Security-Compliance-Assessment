# Why Frequent Password Changes Are a Bad Cybersecurity Practice

I believe that frequent password changes are one of the worst practices in cybersecurity. Itâ€™s time to stop treating outdated password myths as best practices. This approach could have made sense decades ago, it's outdated today and even counterproductive. According to the latest NIST SP 800-63B-4 guidelines (August 2024) it suggests people to change passwords when there is evidence or a sign of compromise not on a fixed schedule. 

Forcing regular password resets often leads users to create weaker and more predictable variations (e.g., "Admin123" becomes "Admin321 or admin123") which constantly burdens people with remembering credentials frequently. In reality I believe if the password is  strong, unique and has long passphrases that tends to be more secure than short, frequently changed passwords. Unless someone uses overly simple passwords like 123456 or Admin123.

We should use of tools like password managers to significantly reduce human error for making password management highly secure and less frustrating. The chances of passwords being compromise are significantly reduced when proper we properly use security practices using password manager, using different credentials for multiple platforms, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) and as well as checking against breach databases for staying ahead and adding extra layer of protection.
