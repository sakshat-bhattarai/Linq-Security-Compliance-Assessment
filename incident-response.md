# Incident Response Plan for Phishing Scenario üõ°Ô∏è

## Incident Overview
An employee reports a phishing email that appeared to be from our CEO. They clicked a link, entered their password, and realized hours later that it was a scam.

## Step-by-Step Actions to Investigate and Remediate the Phishing Incident

### Step 1: Immediate Isolation

- **Isolate User Account:**  
The first step should be identifying and resetting the compromised employee's account password to cut off access from the scammer.

- **Terminate Active Sessions:**  
Although the device has been isolated from the scammer, there might be active sessions still open under the employee's account. The next step is identifying and closing all active sessions (on both on-premises and cloud platforms) associated with the employee.

- **Isolate Device:**  
At this point, the scammer may have already infected the employee's device with malware. To prevent further damage, the device should be isolated from the network as soon as possible.

### Step 2: Notification

#### Internal Notifications:

All internal personnel responsible for incident management, investigation, and mitigation should be promptly notified. Proper notification can help avoid confusion and service delays, ensuring coordinated action during the incident response. The internal personnel to notify include:

- **Incident Response Team**
- **IT Department**
- **Human Resources (HR)**
- **Employee‚Äôs Direct Manager**
- **Legal Department**

#### External Notifications:
- **Notify CISA (for government-related incidents)**
- **Inform third-party vendors or external security resources (if required for investigation)**

### Step 3: Investigation and Analysis

- **Email Analysis:** Check the email domain, headers, content, and embedded URLs to identify phishing techniques used by the scammer.
- **Account Logs Review:** Review the account logs of the compromised account to find suspicious login attempts.
- **Network and System Logs:** Investigate the organization's network and firewall logs (including IPS/IDS) to trace unauthorized activities.
- **Malware Analysis:** Examine the affected device to detect any traces of malware.

### Step 4: Eradication and Recovery

- Restore the affected device to a known secure baseline.
- Reinstate the employee‚Äôs account with Multi-factor Authentication (MFA).
- Continuously monitor the employee‚Äôs accounts and devices for abnormalities.

### Step 5: Post-Incident Activities

- Document all actions taken during the incident response, including timelines and gathered information.
- Conduct a blameless post-incident meeting with all stakeholders to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement.
- Update the incident response plan and cybersecurity training based on findings from the post-incident meeting to better handle similar future situations.

## Long-Term Improvements

### Security Awareness Training

- Conduct interactive phishing-awareness training and simulations to assess effectiveness.
- Train employees on best practices for creating, managing, and protecting strong passwords through interactive sessions.
- Train employees on how to report suspicious activity or security incidents.
- Hold semiannual cybersecurity workshops and quizzes to stay updated on various threat vectors and delivery methods.

### Technical Enhancements
- Enforce Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) across all critical accounts and services.
- Deploy real-time URL scanning and email filtering solutions to detect and block suspicious emails.

### Policy and Procedural Updates
- Review and update incident response plans quarterly.
- Clearly document and report procedures for handling suspicious emails and cybersecurity incidents.
- Define clear roles and responsibilities for managing and escalating incidents within a well-established incident response team.
