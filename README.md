This repository includes my responses to the tasks provided by Linq, focused on practical  business-aligned approaches to security and compliance challenges. 

##  Deliverables

### 1. 📂 `incident-response.md`  
**Scenario:**  
An employee received a phishing email impersonating the CEO, clicked a malicious link, and entered their password.  

**Response Includes:**  
Response outlines a comprehensive incident response plan for handling a phishing attack, starting from immediate containment steps such as account password resets, session terminations, and device isolation. It then details internal and external notification procedures, a thorough investigation process, and recovery actions including system restoration and MFA enforcement. Finally, it emphasizes post-incident documentation, employee training, technical improvements, and policy updates to strengthen future resilience.
