# Security Questionnaire Handling Process

It is very important to manage customer security questionnaires during the assement process by maintaining trust of the customers. This document outlines a structured process for handling incoming security questionnaires at Linq it is very necessary to maintain consistent responses to the customers by minimizing operational friction across teams.
I have developed six key steps from intake and ownership assignment to response submission for handling the questionnaire. This framework not only enhances internal efficiency but also elevates the customer experience by improving transparency and reducing turnaround time.

### Step 1. Using Centralized Intake and Ticket Creating Mechanism  
Routing all customer questionnaires to a shared email alias, such as security.questionnaire@linqapp.com and automating ticket tracking using tools like Airtable, Zendesk, etc to manage the process from intake to final delivery back to the customer.

### Step 2. Early-Stage Response  
Determining the responsible personnel/Team for completing the questionnaire and determine the SLAs on the central ticket tracking system based on complexity and customer urgency.

**Who Should Be Involved:**  
To ensure timely, accurate, and efficient responses to customer security questionnaires, the following teams should be involved:

- **Sales or Customer Success Team**  
They should be the first point of contact for receiving the questionnaire and they should be responsible for maintaining communication between customers and the internal teams.

- **Cybersecurity and Compliance Team**  
Cybersecurity and Compliance teams should be the primary owner of the responses they should be responsible for filling up the questionnaire with high accuracy with alignment with security policies such as Data Protection and Privacy Policy, Physical Security Policy, Incident Response Policy, etc. and compliance frameworks (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001). They should be also responsible to maintain and update historical questionnaires and responses for references.

- **Engineering Team (if needed)**  
The Engineering team should be involved in handling security questionnaires to provide accurate technical details about the system architecture, data flows and implementation of security controls.

- **Legal Team (if needed)**  
The Legal Team should review contractual and legal terms to ensure that privacy, data protection, and regulatory claims adhere to the legal obligations.

### Step 3. Centralized Repository and Evidence Gathering  
Using the tools like **Vanta**, **Confluence**, **Notion**, **Google Drive** (as a lightweight alternative) to build and maintain a centralized, version-controlled repository for SOC 2 reports, security policies and all the security certifications. This repository should include commonly requested answers for industry-standard questionnaires such as CAIQ or SIG. It should also contain the document supporting evidence like MFA enforcement, encryption practices, and access logs.

**Notes:**  
Automation platforms like Vanta, Drata, etc integrate with cloud systems to continuously monitor and collect evidence (e.g., MFA status, audit logs), auto-update compliance dashboards and generate reports on-demand. This not only speeds up the questionnaire response process but also ensures responses are current, complete and consistent reducing back-and-forth and saving valuable time for security and sales teams.

### Step 4. Internal Review and Approvals  
Internal review and approval of questionnaire responses can be streamlined by collaborating natively by using the tools like Vanta or Google Docs/Excel. It should assign each section of a questionnaire to its appropriate owner (Security and Compliance Team, Legal Team or Engineering Team) based on the type of questionnaire for ensuring subject matter expertise is applied where needed. The use of tools (Vanta or Google Docs/Excel) allows team members to leave comments and approve content in real time, reducing the back-and-forth communication on email or slacks.

### Step 5. Submission and Trust Center Use  
Once the questionnaire is finalized, it should be returned to the customer in their preferred format (e.g., spreadsheet, PDF, secure upload). To reduce future back-and-forth and promote transparency, Linq can provide customers with access to a Trust Center where security documentation and certifications are available for self-service. This centralized portal allows customers to subscribe to real-time updates new security certifications or updated policies for improving both accessibility and communication.

### Step 6. Post-Submission Improvements  
Once questionnaire is submitted itâ€™s very important to analyze and identify opportunities for further improvement. Linq can track common questions response time and which responses are most frequently reused or customized by using its analytics. This data can be used to continually update and refine Centralized Repository. In addition, deploying AI-powered chatbots such which are integrated into Trust Center can help tackle repetitive questions, allowing the team to focus on higher-value requests while still delivering top notch answers to the customers.
